                    <span>Welcome to the #Innerclan community!</span>
                    <span>Whether it's your boredom or your curiosity that has got you here, we are super excited to give you a little insight into the BTS of InnerClan! </span>
                    <span>The idea of InnerClan started during the lockdown when we all were stuck at home due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It was simple - create high quality, well designed products that are unique, trendy and that we would want to buy for ourselves, but just couldn’t find. Also, it would have to be responsible and sustainability-conscious, all the way through.</span>
                    <span>Our t-shirts are made with 100% organic cotton,  which makes them incredibly soft, non-irritating and comfortable, but just as durable. We have been learning by doing. Passion, curiosity and the go-getter attitude has led the way into starting this brand that is meant to represent us and YOU!</span>
