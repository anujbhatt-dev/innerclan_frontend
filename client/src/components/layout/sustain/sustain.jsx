                    <span>From the inside out, our t-shirts reflect our philosophy of sustainability, responsibility and keeping it cool and trendy! </span>
                    <span>They’re made with 100% organic cotton. What’s better about it?</span>
                    <span>It’s kinder to the environment</span>
                    <span>Conventional cotton farming uses excessive amounts of harmful pesticides and water. According to the WWF, it takes approximately 5,283 gallons to produce about 2 pounds of cotton. That’s water best used elsewhere, especially with water shortages around the world. Cotton also uses about 10% of pesticides worldwide. The poisons and carcinogens from the pesticides pollute our water bodies, waterways and all the rich fauna found there.</span>
                    <span>Organic cotton uses much less water and is also GMO-free (Genetically Modified Organism).</span>
                    <span>It’s kinder to other humans </span>
                    <span>Toxic pesticides find their way into the cotton farmers’ and our bodies, and food chains on the farms or through water. WHO’s figures state that 20000 people in developing countries die each year at the hand of pesticides. Additionally, the cotton spinning process also features the use of harmful chemicals.</span>
                    <span>This use of harmful pesticides is eliminated with organic cotton because why should there be a human cost to the clothes we wear.</span>
                    <span>It’s kinder to you!</span>
                    <span>The non-toxic textile of organic cotton is non-irritating, much softer and easy going on sensitive skin. </span>
                    <span>We package it in kraft paper, recycled newspaper and paper-based tape. Plastic-free all the way!</span>
                    <span>Kraft products and packaging are cost-effective, eco-friendly and look great too! Kraft paper is produced by pulverizing and blending wood pulp material into rolls of brown filament. Since these filaments are not colour treated, the material retains its natural brown colour (better for the ‘gram!) Minimal chemical processing also means it is 100% biodegradable. Unlike their plastic-based counterparts that can take up to hundreds of years to decompose, kraft products can start decomposing in two to six weeks. They are strong and durable, and can also be easily recycled by environmentally-conscious customers.</span>
